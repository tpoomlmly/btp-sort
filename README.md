# BTP Sort

> If you see something that doesn't look right, speak to staff or text the British Transport Police on 61016. We'll sort it. See it, Say it, Sorted.

This sorting algorithm was invented and is regularly used by the British Transport Police. It has involves three main steps:

1. See the list
2. Say the list
3. The list is sorted

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
2. Download btp_sort.py and put it in the same directory as your project

```python
from btp_sort import btp_sort

lst = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]

sorted_lst = btp_sort(lst)

print(sorted_lst)
# prints [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]
```
